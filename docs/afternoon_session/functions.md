# Functions

!!!- info "Learning objectives"

    - Use a for loop
    - Write a function without an argument and without a return type
    - Write a function that calls a function
    - Write a function that requires an argument
    - Write a function with a return value

???- question "For teachers"

    Teaching goals are:

    * Learners have used a for loop
    * Learners have written functions

    Lesson plan:

    * 5 mins: prior knowledge
    * 5 mins: presentation
    * 15 mins: challenge
    * 5 mins: feedback
