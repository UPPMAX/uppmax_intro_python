# Learning outcomes

Below are the learning outcomes of this course,
as copied from [its evaluation](evaluation.md).
The course is learner-centered ([why?](faq.md#why-is-the-course-learner-centered)),
hence the pace is determined be the learners (i.e. not by the clock).


You can be reasonably sure you'll do this:

- I am comfortable using the documentation of my HPC center
- I am comfortable using the Python book
- I am comfortable learning Python
- I can login to my HPC cluster
- I can load a Python version on my HPC cluster
- I can describe what the Python programming language is
- I can describe what the Python interpreter is
- I can use a text editor on my HPC cluster
- I can create a Python script
- I can run a Python script
- In Python, I can create a variable
- In Python, I can use a variable
- I can convert a simple equation to Python code
- In Python, I can find and use the operator for exponentiation
- In Python, I know what the modulo operator is and when to use it
- I can convert a simple text question to Python code

Here are the rest of the learning outcomes, each item being less and less
likely to be discussed:

- In Python, I can ask a user for input
- In Python, I can use user input in a calculation
- I can find and use a Python module on my HPC cluster
- In Python, I can read a file
- In Python, I can create a file
- In Python, I can use command-line arguments
- In Python, I can import the `matplotlib` library
- In Python, I can use a for loop
- In Python,
  I can write a function without an argument and without a return type
- In Python, I can write a function that calls a function
- In Python, I can write a function that requires an argument
- In Python, I can write a function with a return value
