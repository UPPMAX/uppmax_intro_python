# Frequently Asked Questions

## When to follow the course

### When should I follow this course?

!!! tip

    > Great course. Now, Python is not scary anymore.
    
    A learner from this course ([source](evaluations/20240830/README.md))

When you want to get started with Python.

Especially at the start of any new programming language,
having help is very useful: some error messages seem
like complex, yet have simple solutions. A teacher
helps you get past those first errors.

### When should I consider to **not** follow this course?

These are the reasons to consider to **not** follow this course:

#### Reason 1: you want to learn advanced things

!!! tip

    > for me and I wish we had gotten into the more advanced stuff at the end.
    > But this really reinforced the basics for me
    > and I'm still glad that I did it.

    A learner from this course ([source](evaluations/20240830/README.md))

When you have written your first scripts in Python and
expect to learn new and more advanced things.

In this case, the course will go too slow for you.

However, you will probably be put to work by the teachers
to help out other learners.
If you like to test your own knowledge by teaching others,
you will likely thrive in the course.

#### Reason 2: you have social anxiety

When you have social anxiety.

In this case, the course will be too social for you.

However, in this course, it is perfectly OK to give a wrong
answer or to say 'I do not know'. This is what a former
learner had to say on this:

!!! tip

    > As a learner, you do not want to be berated when giving an answer.
    > Richel tries to gently deal with a wrong answer and he does this great

    A learner from this course ([source](https://uppmax.github.io/uppmax_intro_python/evaluations/20240118/))

You are welcome to try and leave anytime you want.
The course material is made for self-study too, with videos
for all exercises.
Do fill in [the evaluation](evaluation.md)
when you leave early :-)

## Prerequisites

### What are the prerequisites for following this course?

See [prerequisites](prereqs/README.md).

### Why are there so many prerequisites?

Because the newsletter was rushed :-)

### How can I check if I have registered?

???- question "Prefer a video?"

    You can see this question being answered
    in [this YouTube video](https://youtu.be/T8iIuzmjeRI).

- Go to [the course data](data/README.md) page
- Go to the data of your course instance
- View the registrations table. If the MD5 hash of your email address
  is in that table, you are registered.

???- question "Why use an MD5 hash?"

    As a trade-off between privacy and pragmatism.

    - Privacy: do not publish email addresses, however, oneone can find out
      if an email address is registered
    - Pragmatism: a learner should be able to confirm he/she has been registered

???- question "How to use an MD5?"

    Get the MD5 hash of your email address.
    For example, using
    [this website](https://www.md5hashgenerator.com/).
    the email `john.doe@gmail.com` gives the MD5 hash of
    `e13743a7f1db7f4246badd6fd6ff54ff`.
    If this MD5 hash is found in the table of registrations,
    hence, that email address is registered.

Besides that, you should have gotten a welcome email within a couple
of days.

When it doubt, send an email to `richel.bilderbeek@uppmax.uu.se` :-)

### How can I check if I have a user account on a Swedish academic HPC cluster?

When you can login at [https://supr.naiss.se/](https://supr.naiss.se/).

???- question "How does that look like?"

    It should look similar to this:

    ![A user that logged into SUPR](supr_logged_in.png)

### I already have a project on a NAISS HPC cluster. Can I use that one?

Yes, absolutely!

### How can I get a user account on a Swedish academic HPC cluster?

Register at [https://supr.naiss.se/person/register/](https://supr.naiss.se/person/register/).

### How can I apply for an HPC cluster?

In [https://supr.naiss.se/](https://supr.naiss.se/), request a 'Small Compute' project
for either Dardel or Tetralith.

???- question "Should I pick Dardel or Tetralith?"

    Both are fine clusters and there are many ways to compare.

    One way to compare is which cluster is easier to access,
    based on the length of the videos on how to do so:

    <!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 --><!-- Tables cannot be split up over lines, hence will break 80 characters per line -->

    Cluster  |Video                                                                  | Length
    ---------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|-------
    Dardel   |[Log in to Dardel](https://youtu.be/I8cNqiYuA-4?si=4AWNhLhw7e_Dhx0P)   | 7:20
    Tetralith|[Log in to Tetralith](https://youtu.be/wtGIzSBiulY?si=D4OVFYDDVdhW64_V)| 2:18

    <!-- markdownlint-enable MD013 -->

Here are some videos on how to apply:

Tetralith  |[Apply for a Tetralith 'Small Compute' project](https://youtu.be/vjAzURI2ymM)

### How can I check if I can login to an HPC cluster using SSH?

This depends on the HPC cluster you are using.

???- question "How does that look like on UPPMAX's Rackham?"

    For UPPMAX's Rackham, it look similar to this:

    ![Logged into Rackham](rackham_logged_in.png)

### How can I login to an HPC cluster?

See the documentation of your HPC cluster.

Also, these videos may be useful:

Tetralith  |[Log in to Tetralith using SSH](https://youtu.be/wtGIzSBiulY?si=D4OVFYDDVdhW64_V)

### Is it OK if I can login to an HPC cluster using other methods?"

Probably: yes

- Using a website: yes
- Using a local ThinLinc client: yes
- Using WinSCP: yes

### How can I check if I have a good Zoom setup?

- You are in a room where you can talk
- You talk into a (standalone or headset) microphone
- Others can clearly hear you when you talk
- Others can see you
- You can hear others clearly when they talk

### How can I get a good Zoom setup?

- Find/schedule/book a room where you can talk
- Buy a simple headset

### What if I don't have a good Zoom setup? Is that OK?

!!! tip

    > Thank you for creating very interactive [class] room

    A learner from this course ([source](evaluations/20240830/README.md))

No.

You will feel left out, as the course in highly interactive.
It would be weird to the other learners.

## Teaching

### Why is the course learner-centered?

!!! tip

    > I liked Ri-kjells teaching style!

    A learner from this course ([source](evaluations/20240830/README.md))

Because that is good teaching.

This course defines good teaching as 'evidence-based
methods to let learners acquire new skills and the monitoring
of this acquisition'. This means that it should be observed
that learners need more/less to time to practice and following
the schedule based on that. Learner-centered teaching has
an effect size from 0.36 `[Hattie ranking]`
or 0.64/0.70 `[Cornelius-White, 2007][Hattie, 2012]`.

Or: it is useless to go faster than the learners can follow.
Lecturing is known to negatively affect learning `[Hattie, 2023]`.

The teaching methods of this course follow the
evidence-based teaching cycle by `[Bell, 2020a]`,
which allows learner-centered teaching.

## Website

### Why is the repository owner `UPPMAX` instead of NAISS?

Because NAISS does not have a GitHub owner page yet.

This repository will be transferred to a NAISS GitHub owner
page when it exists.

### Why is the repository name `uppmax_intro_python` instead of `naiss_intro_python`?

Because the first name was used in a (rushed!) newsletter.

The name of this repository will be changed to `naiss_intro_python`
after its first iteration.

### Why don't you just publish the Zoom room on the website?

As this course follow [Zoom's recommended practices](https://www.zoom.com/en/products/virtual-meetings/resources/securing-your-meetings/).

## Other

### What if I have another question?

Preferably:

- Add an issue at [https://github.com/UPPMAX/uppmax_intro_python](https://github.com/UPPMAX/uppmax_intro_python).
  This requires a GitHub account and ensures your question is shown publicly
  to all of the course's teaching team

Else:

- Send an email to `richel.bilderbeek@uppmax.uu.se`.
  There is no guarantee on a quick reply here.
