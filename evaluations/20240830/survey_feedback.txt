Great course. Now, Python is not scary anymore.
Thanks for the class today! It was very well organized and I really appreciated your energy. I feel like maybe some things were a little basic for me and I wish we had gotten into the more advanced stuff at the end. But this really reinforced the basics for me and I'm still glad that I did it.
Thank you for creating very interactive calss room 
I liked Ri-kjells teaching style!
